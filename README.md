# PostKeeper App

The PostKeeper app features an image gallery with unique functionality for saving images. Each image has a side icon, allowing users to save their favorite images with a single click. Saved images can be accessed via the "Saved Posts" button conveniently located in the navbar, while a reset button allows users to unsave all images at once.

## Key Features:

- **Save and Manage Posts**: Users can easily save their preferred images with one click and view all saved images using the "Saved Posts" button.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button is provided to allow users to unsave all images instantly.
- **Custom Context Provider**: A custom context provider manages saved posts, providing a clean and centralized approach to app state management.
- **Custom Hook**: The hook is used to extract the context value, making the components more readable and easier to maintain.

This project showcases the effective use of React Context API and hooks for efficient state management in a gallery-based application.
